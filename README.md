I am Carlos Aller, a Solutions Architect and full-stack developer with a long trajectory building software mainly in Java, a few years of nodejs, bash scripting, javascript, typescript, etc.  

Currently interested in REST APIs, GraphQL, mobile backends, containers, Kubernetes, cloud computing, CI / CD methodologies, etc.

I am definitely not the most active github user, just using it to store some pet projects, some code snippets and utilites I find interesting.
