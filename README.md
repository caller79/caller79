Hi!

I am Carlos Aller, a Solutions Architect with a long trajectory doing software mainly in Java, a few years of nodejs, bash scripting, javascript, typescript...  

Currently interested in REST APIs, GraphQL, mobile backends, containers, Kubernetes, cloud computing, CI / CD methodologies, etc.

I am definitely not the most active github user, just using it to store some pet projects, some code snippets and utilites I find interesting. 

Find out more about me in https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosaller/
